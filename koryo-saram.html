Due to poor economic conditions during the Joseon Dynasty, poor families in the north moved towards Far East Siberia. Over the next century, more Koreans migrated to the Far East and naturalized. These Koreans referred to themselves as Koryo Saram, named after the Goryeo dynasty.</p>

                            <p class="steps-description">After constant conflict with the Japanese, Stalin had a distrust in ethnic minorities. Due to language barriers and ethnic looks, Stalin gave Koryo Saram the label of "The Unreliable People". This caused Koryo Saram to have a negative stigma around their neighbors. In accordance with this, Stalin created a plan to send ethnic minorities into the far north. </p>

                            <p class="steps-description">In a period known as "The Great Terror", Stalin proceeded with an ethnic cleansing of the Soviet Union. In order to prevent Japanese espionage, on a sudden day, all Koryo Saram in the Far East were rounded from their homes and forced onto trains. With no concept of time, rest, or nutrition, many died from illness and malnutrition. Close to 172,000 were sent to the undeveloped regions of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Lack of shelter and food in winter lead to many more dying.</p>

                            <p class="steps-description">After the deportation of Koryo Saram, they were tasked by the Soviet Union to farm rice. The diligent Koryo Saram were able to revitalize the agriculture of the desitute areas they were sent to. Despite their loyalty to the Soviet Union, Stalin degraded Korean to a secondary language in 1939 and forbade it from being taught and spoken in 1945. The loss of language has led to a loss of culture and has become a signficant barrier for younger Koryo Saram.</p>

Although Korean language was lost through the third and fourth generation of Koryo Saram, Korean traditions integrated with Soviet culture and gave birth to new foods and culture.

Once the Soviet Union collapsed. countries began to speak their native tongues more. Many working Koryo Saram who only knew Russian were forced out of high end jobs due to language barriers; in pursuit of better economic opportunities, many Koryo Saram began moving to Russia and other countries.

They bring to light the issue that the younger, 4th generation Koreans residing in Korea are facing. Many of them come with their families when they are young and grow up as Koreans. However, unlike their 3rd generation parents who are able to come on blue collar work permits, 4th generation Koryo Saram are no longer considered ethnic Koreans living abroad. Once they turn 19, young Koryo Saram are treated as foreigners, and must struggle with visa issues that prevent them from living with their families. This website is dedicated to raise awareness about the Koryo Saram and help consolidate resources for 3rd and 4th generation Koryo Saram hoping to move to South Korea.</p>
